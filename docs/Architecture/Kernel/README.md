# Kernel Plan

## 1. Setup the Development Environment

First, ensure that your development environment is set up correctly.

- **Install Rust** and its package manager, Cargo. Make sure to install the nightly version of Rust as it contains features not yet in the stable release.

- **Install a Text Editor/IDE** suitable for Rust development. Some examples include Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension or JetBrains CLion with its Rust plugin.

- **Install QEMU**, a machine emulator and virtualizer. This will allow you to test your kernel without needing to reboot your system or use a separate machine.

- **Install bootimage**. It creates a bootable disk image for your Rust OS kernel.

- **Set up a Git Repository**. Having a version control system is crucial in a project as complex as an operating system.

## 2. Barebones Kernel

Start by creating a very minimal kernel that does nothing but boot. At this stage, you'll be focused on setting up the boot process. You will need to:

- **Write a Bootloader**: The bootloader is the first piece of software run by the machine's BIOS. It is responsible for loading the kernel into memory and jumping to its start point.

- **Create the Kernel Entry Point**: Write a `_start` function. This is the first piece of your kernel that will run.

## 3. Host Communication

Set up some basic mechanism to allow the host machine to communicate with the kernel, typically by printing to the console.

- **Set Up VGA Text Buffer**: Write a driver that allows your kernel to print text to the VGA text buffer. This will allow you to print messages to the screen.

## 4. Interrupts and Exceptions

Set up handling for CPU interrupts and exceptions.

- **CPU Exceptions**: These are events triggered by the CPU, like division by zero or page faults.

- **Interrupt Requests (IRQs)**: These are signals sent by hardware devices to gain the CPU's attention.

## 5. Memory Management

One of the kernel's most crucial tasks is managing memory.

- **Physical Memory Management**: The kernel needs to keep track of which frames of physical memory are in use and which are free.

- **Virtual Memory Management**: Implement paging to allow processes to have their own virtual address spaces. This provides isolation between processes and allows for more efficient use of physical memory.

## 6. Multitasking

The kernel should be capable of executing multiple tasks concurrently.

- **Task State Segment (TSS)**: This is a special data structure used by the CPU for task management.

- **Context Switching**: Implement the ability to save the current state of a task (registers, stack pointer, instruction pointer) so that it can be resumed later. This allows the CPU to switch between tasks.

## 7. Interprocess Communication

In a microkernel architecture, system services run as separate tasks and need a way to communicate.

- **Message Passing**: Implement a mechanism for tasks to send messages to each other. This will allow system services to request actions from each other.

This is still quite a high-level plan. Each of these steps is a significant piece of work and involves a lot of complex, detailed coding. This plan is for the kernel only, and a complete operating system would require additional components such as a filesystem, device drivers, a network stack, and a user interface. Additionally, the development of an OS is a significant undertaking and requires a deep understanding of hardware, system programming, and operating system principles.
